# Dikhato â€“ Face-based Photo Filter

This script helps you automatically **filter photos of a specific person** from a large collection.  
You provide:
- A **reference photo** (clear face image of the target person).
- A folder containing **multiple photos** (wedding/party/etc.).

The script will:
1. Detect the face in the reference photo.
2. Scan all photos in the given folder.
3. Copy only the photos containing the reference person into a new folder.
4. Create a **ZIP file** of all matched photos.
